# Phase 2 – Requirements Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This phase identifies and documents the functional and non-functional
requirements of the Tuition Class Management System. These requirements
define what the system should do and the quality attributes it must
satisfy. All requirements documented in this phase are considered final
and approved before moving to the system design phase, in accordance
with the traditional Waterfall model.

## 2. Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe the specific operations and behaviors
the system must support.

| ID  | Description |
|----|-------------|
| FR1 | The system shall allow users to register students by entering personal and contact details. |
| FR2 | The system shall allow administrators to create and manage tuition classes. |
| FR3 | The system shall allow students to be enrolled in one or more classes. |
| FR4 | The system shall allow teachers or administrators to record student attendance for each class session. |
| FR5 | The system shall allow users to view attendance records for individual students and classes. |

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe the quality, performance, and
usability constraints of the system.

| ID   | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| NFR1 | The system shall be easy to use and require minimal training for users. |
| NFR2 | The system shall respond to user actions within two seconds under normal operating conditions. |
| NFR3 | The system shall be available during scheduled class hours. |
| NFR4 | The system shall ensure basic data security through user authentication. |
| NFR5 | The system shall store data reliably without loss under normal usage. |

## 4. Use Case List
Use cases describe how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

- **Register Student** – A user enters student details and creates a new student record.
- **Create Class** – A user creates a tuition class with subject, schedule, and assigned teacher.
- **Enroll Student** – A student is assigned to one or more classes.
- **Mark Attendance** – Attendance is recorded for students in a selected class session.
- **View Records** – Users view student, class, and attendance information.

## 5. Requirement Approval
All requirements listed in this document are reviewed and approved by
stakeholders. No further requirement changes are permitted without
submitting a formal change request, as defined in the Waterfall SDLC.
