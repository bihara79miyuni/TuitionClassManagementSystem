# Phase 1 – Planning

## 1. Problem Statement
The current management of tuition classes is carried out manually using
paper records and basic spreadsheets. This approach leads to frequent
errors in student records, difficulty in tracking attendance accurately,
and inefficiencies in managing class schedules and monthly fees.
Manual methods also make it difficult to retrieve historical data and
generate reports in a timely manner, especially as the number of students
and classes increases.

## 2. Objectives
The main objectives of this system are:
- To automate the student registration process and maintain accurate records
- To manage tuition classes, schedules, and assigned teachers efficiently
- To record and track student attendance in an organized manner
- To reduce manual errors and duplicated data
- To improve overall operational efficiency of the tuition institute

## 3. Scope
### Included in Scope
- Student registration and profile management
- Class creation and scheduling
- Assignment of students to classes
- Attendance recording for each class session
- Basic viewing of attendance and class information

### Excluded from Scope
- Online payment processing
- Mobile application support
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Integration with external systems

## 4. Assumptions
The following assumptions are made during system planning:
- The system will be used by a single tuition institute
- Users will have basic computer literacy
- The system will be operated in a controlled environment
- Data entered by users is assumed to be correct and authorized
- Internet connectivity is available if required for system operation

## 5. Constraints
The development of the system is subject to the following constraints:
- Limited development time due to academic deadlines
- Limited technical and human resources
- Budget constraints preventing the use of paid software tools
- The system must be developed using basic and familiar technologies
- Security features will be limited to basic authentication mechanisms
